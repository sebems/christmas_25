# Oi, Muppets! Merry Christmas!

…thank you. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for having me in your life and for being in my life. Whether it was in school, work, or just life, we have struggled together. Laughed together. And even spilled tea with each other (*oooooooh the tea*). I do not deserve you, hence why I am thankful to God that we are friends, no matter the degree of the relationship. I will care about you with my heart, even with my stoic expressions, I will still care for you.

#### To my friends from home, 

Thank you for reaching out to me. It has been almost half a decade since we were together in person. Thank you for reminding me of where I come from and not to forget so. Thank you for updating me on the state of my home. You do not know how I long to be there with you, in both highs and lows.

#### To my friends from college, 

We survived! We endured trials such as COVID, ENGR 220, and Calvin Dining. Schurmann’s **design norms** are etched into our brains. They have become memes and sources of joy. When I think of myself in other schools, frankly, I cannot. I fear having a life without you. We’ve shared homes, encouraged each other, and even sworn vengeance against certain individuals in Super Smash Bros. (To those enemies-of-state, I know where you live, respectively...) Even though we’re now somewhat spread out across the country or globe, I pray that the bonds we’ve made last well into our primes, and very far beyond.


#### To my work colleagues, 

God bless you for showing me how to balance work and life. Thank you for encouraging me through bouts of imposter syndrome and confusion. Thank you for opening your hearts to me at work. Thank you for the various gifts that you bring to the team. I just pray that in all your endeavours, both in and outside our time in Calvin, my Lord will guide you and keep you.

#### To the community I have in church,

Thank you for being a home away from home. Thank you for being a space where we can be real with each other, especially in our walks of faith. I really enjoy the authenticity of life. I pray the Lord strengthen you and that wherever you are, know these words from 1 John 2: 12-14

To those whom I haven’t gotten to know properly, and to those I know, like the ending of a good anime. I am deeply sorry for the losses, griefs, and unmet expectations you have had to endure this year–the Lord is your strength. But I am equally ecstatic for the news of joy that the Lord has blessed you with–may He continue to bless you with grace where you don’t expect it. Comfort and strength in the confusing and trying times. And peace in this frankly at times crappy, idiotic, and even chickenshite world we live in. With all that said…

# MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR
