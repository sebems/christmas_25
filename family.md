# My Family, My Heart,

I do not deserve you. Your love, your deep bond--may legends and stories be written about it. May the love of God continue to be with you wherever you are.

#### To my grandmothers, 

The matriarchs of Awka and Oba umunne. Your strength thus far is nothing short of God’s miracles and abundant grace. You are both strong rocks upon the Rock, which is Jesus–the One who sees us, the One who is the sole protector of our families. I pray that He will continue to be your peace, shelter, strength, and reason to rejoice in and out of this season of Christmas. I love you both. My apologies for not talking to you as often as I should have. 😂 I hope to see you both soon, by God’s grace.

#### To my Uncles,

Both blood and not, besides my Father in heaven and my father on earth, you have been mentors and wonderful examples to me. Thank you for the wisdom you’ve shown in your lives. For the freedom to be vulnerable as a man, which is often looked at as weakness. You’ve taught me to honor the culture that I come from. You’ve taught me to be strong so that others can be strong, even when at times I’m afraid. Thank you for the encouragement, the reminders of what it means to be a man, and for the constant joys you’ve showered me with. I pray that God our Father bless you and your families richly, with grace, honor, and peace, which is so rare in these times.

#### To my Aunties,

Both blood and not, besides my mother, you have been my mentors and beautiful examples to me. Thank you for the care that you’ve shown to me at my lowest. Thank you for rejoicing with me at my highest points in life. Thank you for showing me what inner strength is, despite the odds. Thank you for the times I need humbling 😂. You taught me to hold fast to my faith. You taught me to hold fast to my family and protect them. You taught me that though culture is important, I can’t blindly follow it. You are all wonderful women, and I pray that God answers your prayers, calms your stressors, and grants you relief and comfort wherever you need it.

#### To my cousins,

Both blood and not, besides my siblings, you have been my good friends. Thank you for the joyful memories. From fighting you in games or arguments to laughing with each other. I’m so grateful that God gave me people like you and allowed me to be a part of your life. I know we haven’t seen each other in a while, and there are a lot of things that I so wanted to be part of. But know this, I love you as I love siblings, and I will fight for you. Please remember me as we go through this life together, wherever we are. I pray that as you grow, you will all become wonderful men and women that you and God will be proud of.

### Mom and Dad

A couple that doesn’t try to seem perfect by any means, because we aren’t. God has given me two wonderful people to model after. Your bond as partners is something that I want to actively emulate in any future relationship that the Lord will lead me into.

Daddy, you are my hero, a standard of what it means to be a man. You’ve somehow managed to balance being stoic and caring at the same time. As a child, I often admired how people sought me for answers and help. You’re not the most expressive person sometimes, but as I’ve learnt with age, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you don’t care. You just tend to think a lot more deeply, and your wisdom is something that I’m so grateful for when I can’t put into words how I’m feeling. It is my prayer that I become a man greater than you, because the shoes that I have are **vast**.

Mommy. Mama. Momsie. You know there will never be another individual like you, and I am so happy that is the case. Because your soul is…is so beautiful, so…so strong. To me, you are a symbol of faith, unshakeable faith that defies logic and normality. Thank you so much for teaching me about my culture, for teaching me how I ought to love those around me.

You both said that you never sent us to school or took care of us to get anything returned. You simply said that you did it out of love. Well, I say this, may God, your God and mine, continue to give us as a family love, joy, peace, and grace. I deeply care for both of you, and I pray that you get to see the man that I become, and I pray that it is with pride…

### Annie and Iva

To my beautiful sister, you are my prized jewels. Annie, no one truly knows the inner strength that you wield. Iva, no one truly knows the charisma and joy you hold within you. Annie, you wear your heart on your sleeve; don’t let anyone tell you that you are too much or too little. Iva, your ability to adapt and make a community you go to is something that few people have in this life. You are both intelligent, beautiful, and gracious women. I thank God that you are in my life. I thank God that I get to be your brother, which is a privilege that I’ll never take for granted.

I pray the Lord strengthen you all and that wherever you are, know these words from 1 John 2: 12-14

>*I am writing to you who are God's children*
>*because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus.*
>
>*I am writing to you who are mature in the faith*
>*because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning.*
>
>*I am writing to you who are young in the faith*
>*because you have won your battle with the evil one.*

# Family Tree

Lastly, here's a [family tree](https://www.ancestry.com/invite-ui/accept?token=KZL1BkUd7yXVhmQy5bXPrek8ei-lj5u8wXRUn2rwT1A=) that I've been building for a few months. Please feel free to look over it and let me know if there's someone I'm missing or anything that needs to be changed.
